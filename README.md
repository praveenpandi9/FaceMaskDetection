# Face Mask Detection Using YOLOV5

# The project is run in MAC M1 environment in jyupiter Notebook, the same is suggested

project.ipynb :
  This is the source file which has code to train and test the yolo model

yolov5 :
  contains the customised yolo V5 model

datasets :
  The dataset contains the datset

# Steps to run the code :

1.) install requirements from requirements.txt using pip install -r requirements.txt

2.) download the datset from kagle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection

3.) place the archive.zip file in datasets

4.) run the project.ipynb 

# Code Flow

1.) First the data set is preprossed
2.) It is then converted into test and train datasets 
3.) The dataset has annotations for each image
4.) Each annotations depicts the boundaries and the class of the object
    classes : { 'with_mask','without_mask','mask_weared_incorrect'}
5.) This xml annoations file is converted into txt file
6.) Which is used to train the yolov5 model
7.) The model is trained and tested with custom images
8.) The neccessary plot are depicted in the project report
9.) The graphs are internally generated by YOLOV5 and stored ar yolov5 ->runs -> train -> exp 
10.) The weights are saved in the same folder

The model has been trained and the best fit model is saved in the directory models/mask_yolov5.pt
